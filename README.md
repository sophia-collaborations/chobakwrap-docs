# chobakwrap-docs
Documentation on 'chboakwrap' package

## Format
This documentation is written in ModuDocXML - an alternative
to DocBook I am working on that I expect will be much more
flexible and scalable.

One of the many differences is that DocBook is clearly
designed with the idea that even if the output is in
several hyperlinked files, the source-document will be
in one file.
Features of DocBook for cases when this isn't so are
tack-ons, afterthoughts -- and make the already-daunting
task of getting DocBook up-and-running even _more_ daunting.

While such a mindset may have had _some_ reasonability in
the days of DocBook's origin -- it is completely defeating
in the days of modern version-control systems - where the
more you separate things in different files, the more
you allow different project contributors to do their work
without stepping on each other's toes.
